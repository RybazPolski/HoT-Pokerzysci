To run our presentation you just need to enter `hackathon_ai_game_web` and run `npm i` to set everything up.
Then `npm run dev`.

Ensure you provided `ASI1_API_KEY` in `.env` file with API KEY for your ASI1-mini, which we use for the prototype.

You can then run agents by running python scripts in following order: `npc.py`, `observer.py`, `agent.py`.

Our project is still W.I.P. but we can demonstrate core functionalities by changing our AI agents code.
